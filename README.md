## Project Overview:

We are embarking on a project at 'Fiscal Fortune Finders,' a consulting firm specialising in the tech SaaS industry. Our primary objective is to enhance the efficiency of four core services:

1. Analytics
2. ERP Implementation
3. Legacy Modernization
4. Technical Business Solutions


Our project focuses on optimising the processes within these services and involves three critical teams:
1. Marketing: Responsible for lead generation and qualification, with a primary metric being lead conversion.
2. Sales: Tasked with converting prospects into opportunities and ultimately achieving Closed-Won status. The key metric here is opportunity status.
3. Customer Success: After successfully closing opportunities, the Customer Success team plays a vital role in retaining customers and preventing churn.
   
## Project Goals:
Our project's overarching goal is to leverage data analytics to predict outcomes in all three critical processes: Marketing, Sales, and Customer Success. By doing so, we aim to empower decision-makers, potentially including Revenue Operations Managers, to take informed actions to safeguard Fiscal Fortune Finder's revenue streams and prevent customer attrition.

In essence, our project will involve data analysis and predictive modelling to enhance lead conversion rates, optimise opportunity management, and minimise churn rates across the organisation's operations.
